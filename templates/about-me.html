    <h1>Who are you?</h1>
    Jake is a fullstack software engineer, born in the Bay Area. Their hobbies include yarn-craft, video games, and lounging with their dogs. As someone who prides themselves as a self-learner, their craft and passions inspired them to develop an arcade hub site featuring hand-made JS based games.

    Professionally, their career has led them through organizations focused on web development in e-commerce and cutting-edge tech with hardware aspects. Seeing the magic of code come to life, quite literally, pushed them to learn the skills it takes to immerse themselves in their work under a more technical lens. 

    Enjoy yourself!
