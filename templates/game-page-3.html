        <b>[CLASSIFIED] Responsibility Rain</b> <br><br>
        After a long day, one can only hope for precious dreams <br>
        of life outside of the norm. Remain lazy, remain in bed. <br>
        But donâ€™t let the intrusive thoughts around your chores <br>
        ruin your day, avoid them at all costs. On the flip side, <br>
        keep the good vibes going and lucid dream your next <br>
        vacation, etc. <br><br>

        Upon every dream-thought you come into contact with, a <br>
        mysterious and beautiful image overwhelms the background of <br>
        your mind. <br><br>

        Ahh, to sleep well.
