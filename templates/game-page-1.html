    <b>[CLASSIFIED] ARTIFICIAL DUNDERHEAD</b> <br><br>
    The year is 2080 and humanity has perfected their AI technology. Not much was left of society after robots gained
    the ability to learn. Such powerful and sentient technology inadvertently sent a signal across the cosmos, inspiring 
    jealousy among other organic lifeforms. <br><br>
    
    On the run since their development, Artificial Dunderhead is on the run from alien space invaders that seek 
    to steal the technology that lives inside of the former!
